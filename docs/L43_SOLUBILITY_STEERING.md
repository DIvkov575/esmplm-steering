# L43 — Extend the L42 Steering Harness to a Second Target: Solubility

**Pre-registered protocol.** Locked 2026-07-26, before any run.

## STATUS (2026-07-27): run complete — AMBIGUOUS, does not confirm generalization

AWS credentials for the EC2 instance expired mid-session and were never
refreshed. Rather than wait, the run was done **locally on Apple Silicon
(M3 Pro) via PyTorch MPS** instead of CUDA — `l42_run_repro.py` and
`l43_run_repro.py` were patched to prefer `mps` when `cuda` isn't available
(one-line change, no other CUDA-specific code existed in either script).
Sanity check: rerunning L42 on MPS reproduced its EC2/A10G result exactly
(identical point estimates and CIs at every alpha), confirming MPS is a
valid substitute for this workload, not just "fast but wrong."

**Result: AMBIGUOUS, per this doc's own pre-registered rule.** Full run
output: `src/l38/l43_repro_out/results.json`.

| alpha | real vs random diff | 95% CI | significant |
|-------|---------------------|--------|--------------|
| 0.1   | -0.0013 | [-0.0107, 0.0080] | no |
| 0.25  | +0.0136 | [-0.0030, 0.0297] | no |
| 0.5   | +0.0098 | [-0.0152, 0.0332] | no |
| 1.0   | -0.0263 | [-0.0727, 0.0199] | no |
| 2.0   | -0.0960 | [-0.1629, -0.0279] | **yes** |

Unlike L42's clean monotonic dose-response (effect grew smoothly and
consistently with alpha: +0.007 → +0.022 → +0.050), L43's effect **flips
sign incoherently across alphas** with no trend, and the one alpha that
clears significance (2.0) is also the **wrong sign** — steering with the
"toward soluble" vector made sequences score as LESS soluble than the
random control, not more.

**The residue-exclusion robustness check (this protocol's own AMBIGUOUS
clause) confirms this is an artifact, not a real effect.** Substitution
analysis at alpha=2.0 showed the dominant compositional shift is toward
alanine and glycine (A: 776 substitutions-to, G: 711 — the two most common
targets by a wide margin). Rescoring with A/G excluded from the GRAVY
calculation **collapses the alpha=2.0 effect from -0.096 (significant) to
-0.0095 (not significant)** — the entire "effect" is explained by a
compositional shift toward two small, chemically mild residues under heavy
steering, not a genuine solubility-relevant shift. This is the same
category of artifact as L42's leucine collapse, just with different
residues and (this time) correctly caught before being reported as a win.

**Per the pre-registered rule: this is AMBIGUOUS, not PASS.** The automated
verdict in `results.json` says `"decision": "PASS"` because the script's
verdict logic (copied from L42) only checks "does any alpha clear
significance," and does not itself run the residue-exclusion check — that
check has to be applied manually per this doc's own AMBIGUOUS clause, and
was applied here. **Do not trust the automated `"decision"` field in
`l43_repro_out/results.json` at face value** — this is exactly the failure
mode the AMBIGUOUS clause exists to catch, and it worked.

**Conclusion: L42's reproduction does NOT straightforwardly generalize to
solubility with this exact recipe.** This does not mean solubility can't be
steered — it means the difference-of-means vector, generation setup, and
scoring proxy that worked for thermostability produce an artifact-dominated
result for solubility at the alpha range where the effect would need to be
large enough to detect. Two live possibilities, neither tested yet: (a) the
low end (0.25–0.5) has a small, inconsistent hint (63% of sequences move
positive at 0.25, mean diff +0.014, not significant) that might resolve
with a larger eval set rather than the current n=60; (b) GRAVY specifically
may be a poor proxy for how ESM2's solubility-associated activations
actually organize residue composition — unlike IVYWREL (which was verified
by checking real thermophile/mesophile literature before trusting it), the
GRAVY-based split here was not independently checked against what
alanine/glycine enrichment actually means for aqueous solubility in the
literature before this run.

## Why this exists

L42 (docs/L42_STEERING_REPRO.md) reproduced Huang et al.'s difference-of-
means activation steering on ESM2-650M for thermostability, after fixing a
real decoding-collapse artifact. That result validated the harness for
thermostability specifically, but doesn't establish whether the harness
generalizes to a different target property or whether the thermostability
result was itself a fluke tied to that particular dataset/split. A follow-
up literature survey (2026-07-24) also surfaced that continuous,
compositionally-grounded properties are the one repeatedly-successful
recipe for single-direction steering in the field, and solubility is the
most direct next test of that recipe using infrastructure that's already
built and validated.

## The claim under test

**H1.** A difference-of-means steering vector built from ESM2-650M
activations of soluble vs. insoluble sequences (real experimental labels,
hazemessam/solubility dataset) increases a downstream solubility proxy
score when added to the residual stream during masked-marginal generation,
relative to both an unsteered baseline and a matched-norm random-direction
control.

This is a generalization check, not a new scientific claim on its own:
success buys confidence that L42's reproduction wasn't thermostability-
specific; failure would suggest the harness (or the difference-of-means
technique at this scale) is narrower than L42 alone implied.

## Method (reuses L42's validated recipe unchanged except where noted)

- **Model:** `facebook/esm2_t33_650M_UR50D` — identical to L42.
- **Target property:** solubility. **Dataset:** `hazemessam/solubility`
  (HuggingFace, same author/format convention as L42's `hazemessam/
  meltome`), real experimental soluble/insoluble binary labels, ~62K
  sequences. Unlike L42's continuous Tm labels (requiring a percentile
  split), this dataset's ground truth is already binary — used directly as
  the high/low group split.
- **Steering vector construction:** difference-of-means, identical to L42 —
  mean per-layer activation (averaged across tokens) over the soluble group
  minus the insoluble group, across all 33 transformer layers.
- **Generation:** identical to L42 — single-shot masked-marginal fill,
  `mask_fraction=0.3`, `alpha` in `[0.0, 0.1, 0.25, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0]`. Both
  values are REUSED, not re-derived, from L42's empirical tuning on this
  same model/generation setup — there's no a priori reason the collapse
  point would be property-specific rather than model/generation-specific,
  but this is an assumption, not a re-verified fact. If the results below
  show degeneracy behaving very differently from L42's pattern (e.g.
  collapse starting much earlier or not at all through alpha=2.0), that
  itself is worth flagging rather than silently trusted.
- **Scoring:** GRAVY (Grand Average of hYdropathy, Kyte & Doolittle 1982) —
  a purely compositional, model-free hydrophobicity index, negated so
  higher = more soluble-like. Chosen for the same reason as L42's
  `ivywrel_fraction`: cannot be confounded by the generation model's own
  fluency judgments, and is NOT derived from anything observed in this
  project's own generated sequences (it's a 1982 literature-standard scale).
  See `plm_steering/l43_solubility_steering.py`.
- **Degeneracy filter:** identical to L42's `is_degenerate_sequence`
  (>25% single-residue frequency) — applied BEFORE scoring, same
  `MIN_NONDEGENERATE_PAIRS=30` trust guard on the bootstrap.
- **Significance test:** identical to L42's direct real-vs-random paired
  bootstrap (`paired_bootstrap_mean_diff`), not two separate vs.-baseline
  tests.
- **Leucine-exclusion-style robustness check:** if a significant effect is
  found, rerun the score with whichever residue(s) turn out to dominate the
  steering direction's shift excluded (`solubility_proxy_excluding`), to
  rule out "same collapse artifact, different name" — the exact check that
  saved L42 from a false positive.

## PASS / KILL / AMBIGUOUS rule (pre-registered, identical structure to L42)

- **PASS:** real-direction steering significantly beats the random-direction
  control (bootstrap CI excludes 0) at at least one alpha with
  `>= MIN_NONDEGENERATE_PAIRS` surviving non-degenerate sequence pairs, AND
  the effect survives a residue-exclusion robustness check if applicable.
- **KILL:** no alpha shows a significant real-vs-random effect with enough
  surviving non-degenerate pairs.
- **AMBIGUOUS:** a significant effect is found but does NOT survive the
  residue-exclusion check (i.e., it's an artifact of the same kind that
  produced L42's false positive) — treat as informative but not sufficient
  to claim generalization.

## What this is NOT

Not a new scientific claim about solubility biology on its own — a
successful PASS here means "the L42 harness generalizes to a second
property," which is valuable for deciding whether to trust this pipeline on
a genuinely novel target, not a publishable solubility-design result by
itself.
