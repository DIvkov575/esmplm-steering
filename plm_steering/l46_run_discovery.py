"""L46: run InterPLM's pretrained SAE over real sequences and rank discovered
features by selectivity, with ZERO target property specified anywhere in
this process -- the opposite of L42/L43/L45, which all required choosing a
property (thermostability, solubility) before running anything.

Method: encode many real sequences' per-residue activations through the
SAE, track every feature's firing pattern, then rank features by a
selectivity score that doesn't reference any biological label: how
sparse/concentrated a feature's firing is (fires strongly on a small
fraction of residues, rather than diffusely everywhere -- InterPLM's own
finding is that the useful, interpretable features look like this, while
uninteresting/noise-fitting features fire diffusely). This is a real
proxy for "found a genuine pattern" vs. "found nothing," computable BEFORE
any human or downstream label ever gets involved.

After ranking, the TOP features get characterized post-hoc (which
sequences/residues each one fires most strongly on) purely for a human
to read and interpret -- this final labeling step is unavoidable (a
u ndiscovered feature has no name until someone looks at what it
responds to), but the discovery/ranking step itself is fully unsupervised.
