"""L49: unsupervised causal candidate generation for ProtBert-BFD attention
heads -- ablate EVERY head (30 layers x 16 heads = 480), rank by ACTUAL
CAUSAL EFFECT on masked-residue prediction, with ZERO correlational
attention-weight information used to pick candidates.

This is a genuinely different candidate-generation procedure from Vig et
al. 2021 and from this project's own L48 Stage 1: those both rank heads by
correlation (attention-on-contacts fraction) and only test the top pick
causally. This ranks ALL heads by causal effect directly -- the correlation
step is skipped entirely during discovery, and only used AFTERWARD (in the
cross-check section) to see whether causal and correlational rankings
agree, disagree, or find different heads. Three outcomes are all
informative; none is assumed going in.

Coarse-first design (matches this project's convention in L45's layer
sweep before its full run): a SUBSAMPLE of positions across all 8 real PDB
structures (not the full 770 used in L48's targeted 2-head test), since
testing all 480 heads on the full position set would take ~3 hours on this
hardware vs. ~24 minutes for a representative subsample.
