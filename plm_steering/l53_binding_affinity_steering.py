"""L53: extend the L42 activation-steering harness (validated on
thermostability, docs/L42_STEERING_REPRO.md) to a NEW target property --
binding affinity -- using a proxy validated against real experimental labels
BEFORE the run, per L50 criterion 4 (the L43 GRAVY lesson: r=-0.03 discovered
only after that whole run had been wasted).

Dataset: ProteinGym DMS assay RASK_HUMAN_Weng_2022_binding-DARPin_K55
(plm_steering/data_cache/binding/), 24,873 non-indel variants of a single 188-residue
KRAS backbone, each with a real experimentally-measured binding score against
the DARPin K55 binder. Chosen over the other six cached binding assays because
it is the only one that is both large enough and short enough: SPIKE_SARS2,
DLG4_RAT and SPG1_STRSG have ZERO sequences at or under the harness's
MAX_SEQ_LEN=400 (their backbones are longer), and of the three that survive
length filtering, RASK is the largest (24,873 vs 6,137 CCR5 / 3,344 Q53Z42) and
the one where the proxy validates most strongly.

Proxy: mutational-sensitivity-weighted wildtype preservation, normalized by
overall sequence identity. Positions where mutations empirically destroy
binding (learned from the TRAIN split's labels only) get high weight; a
sequence scores well if it preserves the wildtype residue preferentially at
those binding-critical positions, over and above its overall fidelity to the
backbone. Validated against real labels before any steering run:

  proxy                          full r  full rho   test r  test rho
  weighted_id (raw)              +0.805    +0.814   +0.806    +0.813
  normalized (w - unweighted)    +0.795    +0.793   +0.797    +0.794
  blosum62_to_wt                 +0.273    +0.274   +0.257    +0.258
  net_charge                     +0.255    +0.266   +0.256    +0.267
  unweighted identity            +0.224    +0.235   +0.214    +0.224
  gravy                          +0.106    +0.079   +0.119    +0.091
  aromatic fraction              +0.014    +0.004   +0.010    +0.002

The NORMALIZED variant is used as the proxy rather than the marginally-stronger
raw one, because raw weighted identity is confoundable by generic
reconstruction fidelity: in this harness both the real-direction and
random-direction arms mask-fill 30% of positions, so a steering vector that
merely made generation more faithful to its input would raise raw weighted
identity without conferring any binding-specific capability. Subtracting
unweighted identity removes exactly that channel. Confirmed on simulated
random-position mutants carrying no binding signal, at increasing mutational
load (the regime generated sequences actually live in, far beyond this assay's
1-2 mutations):

  frac mutated   weighted_id   unweighted_id   normalized
          0.00        1.0000          1.0000      -0.0000
          0.10        0.9087          0.9093      -0.0006
          0.20        0.8157          0.8129      +0.0028
          0.30        0.7111          0.7169      -0.0058

Raw weighted identity tracks mutational load steeply (1.00 -> 0.71) while the
normalized variant stays pinned at ~0 with no trend -- it is blind to fidelity
alone and responds only to WHERE the preserved positions are.

Three further checks that this is real position-specific binding knowledge and
not an artifact, all run before the steering script was written:

  * Weight-shuffle control: permuting the learned weights across positions
    destroys the signal completely (r=-0.001, sd 0.101 over 10 shuffles) versus
    r=+0.805 with real weights. The predictive content is in WHICH positions
    are sensitive, not in similarity-to-wildtype generally.
  * Held-out POSITION generalization: fitting weights with 46 of 187 mutated
    positions entirely withheld still gives r=+0.541 / rho=+0.497 on variants
    at those unseen positions -- a real per-position scale, not a lookup table.
  * Mutational-load extrapolation: weights fit on single mutants only (n=3,084)
    transfer to double mutants (n=21,789) at r=+0.695 / rho=+0.733.

Rejected candidate, recorded rather than quietly dropped: a per-(position,
residue) mean-label-offset table ("PSSM") scored r=+0.854 on the full set but is
pure label memorization -- on the single-mutant assays it returns a CONSTANT on
held-out data, because no test mutant's exact (position, residue) pair ever
appears in the train table. High full-set r, zero generalization.
