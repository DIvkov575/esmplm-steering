"""L42: pure-math/data-plumbing pieces for reproducing Huang et al.'s
activation steering (arXiv:2509.07983) on ESM2-650M toward thermostability.

Model-forward-pass pieces (embedding extraction, hooking, generation) live
in l42_run_repro.py, which requires ESM2-650M on a GPU and isn't
unit-testable without one. This module holds what IS testable without a
model: difference-of-means vector construction, high/low group splitting,
and the steering-hook math (verified against synthetic tensors here, then
reused against real activations in l42_run_repro.py).
