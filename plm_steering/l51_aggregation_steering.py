"""L51: extend the L42 activation-steering harness (validated on
thermostability, studies/L42_STEERING_REPRO.md) to a NEW target property --
aggregation propensity -- using a proxy that was checked against real
experimental labels BEFORE this run, unlike L43's GRAVY (which was found,
after the fact, to correlate only r=-0.03 with real solubility labels).

Dataset: cmartell/50C_Aggregation (HuggingFace), 13,853 real sequences with
experimental log2(fold-change in soluble fraction after 50C heat stress) --
more negative label = more aggregation-prone. Cleaned to plain amino-acid
sequences in plm_steering/data_cache/aggregation/agg50_clean.csv.

Proxy: net charge (fraction of D/E minus fraction of K/R/H), validated
directly against this dataset's real labels: r=-0.20 (p~3e-129) on the full
set, r=-0.21 (p~1e-29) on the held-out test split alone -- confirmed NOT a
length confound. Decomposing further (negative charge r=+0.17, positive
charge r=-0.13) matches Lawrence et al. 2007 (JACS, "Supercharging Proteins
Can Impart Unusual Resilience") -- engineered net-negative charge increases
aggregation resistance, a real, independently-published mechanism, not a
formula invented for this project (the GRAVY lesson from L43).
