"""L47 Task B: validate the activation-patching harness (l47_activation_patching.py)
against L42's already-trusted thermostability result, BEFORE trusting it on
the novel Task A (redo Vig et al.'s attention-head finding causally).

Method, distinct from L42/L45's steering (ADD alpha*vector to activations):
this SUBSTITUTES the mean-pooled high-Tm-group activation directly in place
of a low-Tm eval sequence's own activation, at a given layer's residual
stream, restricted to the MASKED positions only (the ones actually being
predicted) -- broadcasting the same vector to every position, including
unmasked context the model needs to make any coherent prediction, was
tried first and found too destructive: a smoke test at N=5 showed 100%
degenerate output at every single layer (see docs/L47_ACTIVATION_PATCHING.md
for the full account). Patching only the positions under prediction is both
less destructive and more principled: it substitutes exactly the
information the model is being asked to fill in, not the context it reads
FROM. Real proteins have no natural token-to-token alignment across
different sequences (unlike paired-template LLM patching, e.g. "John gave
it to Mary" vs. "Mary gave it to John"), so this uses a single mean-pooled
vector broadcast across whichever positions get masked for a given eval
sequence, rather than any position-specific correspondence.

If a low-Tm sequence generated under this patch scores as more
thermostability-like than its own unpatched baseline, that's a genuinely
different causal test than L42's steering (substitution vs. addition)
converging on the same conclusion -- not a restatement of L42.

Reuses L42's exact data groups, degeneracy filter, IVYWREL scorer, and
paired-bootstrap significance test. Does NOT reuse mask_fill_generate
directly since that function has no hook into which positions get masked
before generation runs -- reimplemented here with the identical masking
logic (same seed convention) so the patch can target exactly those positions.
