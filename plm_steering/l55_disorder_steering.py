"""L55: extend the L42 activation-steering harness (validated on
thermostability, studies/L42_STEERING_REPRO.md) to a NEW target property --
intrinsic disorder (IDR) content -- using a proxy validated against real
per-residue disorder annotations BEFORE the run, per L50 criterion 4.

Dataset: DisProt current release (https://disprot.org/api/search), 3324
entries with canonical-AA-only sequences, cleaned to
plm_steering/data_cache/disorder/disprot_clean.csv. Unlike every prior target in
this arc (thermostability/solubility/aggregation, all one scalar per whole
sequence), disorder has real GROUND TRUTH PER RESIDUE: each entry carries
DisProt's curated consensus disordered regions, reduced here to a
per-sequence scalar (fraction of residues inside a curated disordered
region) for the difference-of-means split, and retained per-residue for the
extra AUC validation below. The derived per-sequence fraction correlates
r=0.84 with DisProt's own `disorder_content` field (differences are
ambiguous/non-"D" region types), confirming the reduction is faithful.

Proxy: TOP-IDP scale (Campen et al. 2008, Protein Pept Lett 15:956-963,
"TOP-IDP-scale: a new amino acid scale measuring propensity for intrinsic
disorder") -- a published, experimentally-derived per-residue disorder
propensity scale, mean-pooled over the sequence. Chosen over three
alternatives after validating ALL of them against real labels first:

  proxy              pearson r   spearman   test-split r
  TOP-IDP              +0.449     +0.362      +0.482
  simple_comp          +0.443     +0.359      +0.446
  FoldIndex (flipped)  +0.385     +0.334      +0.372
  neg. hydropathy      +0.372     +0.311      +0.382

TOP-IDP wins and is NOT a length confound: partial correlation controlling
for sequence length is r=+0.428 (vs raw +0.449), and it holds within every
length tertile (+0.342 / +0.466 / +0.515). Per-residue rigor check (richer
than any prior target in this arc allowed): sliding-window mean TOP-IDP vs.
DisProt's per-residue D/O labels over 354,556 residues gives AUC=0.713
(window=21; 0.710 at 31, 0.700 at 41) -- the proxy discriminates
disordered from ordered residues, not just whole-sequence averages.

This is ~2.2x the effect size of L51's pre-validated aggregation proxy
(r=+0.20) and a different universe from L43's GRAVY (r=-0.03, discovered
only after that run had already been wasted).
