"""L44: test whether L42/L43's over-steering collapse residue (leucine for
thermostability, alanine/glycine for solubility) is predictable in advance
from the steering vector itself, via a logit-lens-style projection through
the model's own unembedding (lm_head), BEFORE ever generating a single
sequence.

Motivation: in both L42 and L43, pushing alpha too high didn't produce
random garbage -- it collapsed to one specific, consistent amino acid (or
pair), and that residue was the one over-represented in whichever group
built the vector. This script checks whether that collapse residue is
visible directly in the vector's projection onto the vocabulary, which
would mean over-steering is not an arbitrary failure mode but a predictable
consequence of pushing the residual stream toward whatever token the
model's own unembedding matrix associates most strongly with that
direction -- checkable cheaply, without any generation, for a NEW target
property before ever running the expensive alpha sweep.

Reuses L42/L43's exact vector-construction code and data (same seed) so
the vectors checked here are identical to the ones that actually steered
generation in those runs -- this is a diagnostic ON the existing results,
not a new experiment.

    Two things were checked and fixed before trusting this:
    1. NOT routed through the full lm_head (dense -> layer_norm ->
       decoder): a self-identity smoke test showed that doing so does NOT
       recover a token's own embedding as its own top match (leucine's
       embedding projects to K/M/<unk> through the full head, since that
       transform is fit for real hidden states, not an arbitrary
       difference vector fed in directly).
    2. NOT raw dot product: non-standard/rare amino-acid codes (B, U, Z,
       O, X) have outlier embedding NORMS (up to 6.15 vs. ~2.4-3.4 for the
       20 standard residues, confirmed by direct inspection), which
       dominated raw dot-product rankings regardless of direction and
       produced a nonsensical top-1 (e.g. "B") on both L42 and L43's real
       vectors. Cosine similarity removes the norm confound. Restricting
       to the 20 standard amino acids (restrict_to_standard_aa=True,
       default) additionally removes rare/special tokens from
       consideration entirely, since only standard residues were ever
       observed in the actual collapse.
