# L57 — Expression Yield Steering: AMBIGUOUS, explained as a geometric echo of L55's disorder direction

**Pre-registered against `studies/L50_CAPABILITY_GAIN_PROTOCOL.md`'s 6
criteria.** One of 5 parallel new-target attempts. The naive real-vs-random
result looks like a clean PASS through criteria 1-2, but fails
residue-exclusion (criterion 3) — and a follow-up vector-geometry check
explains *why*: this target's steering vector is not independent of L55's
(disorder) validated real direction.

## Data and proxy

eSol (Niwa et al. 2009, PNAS — chaperone-free PURE cell-free translation of
the E. coli ORFeome), via HuggingFace `AI4Protein/eSOL`. 3101 distinct
E. coli proteins, continuous label in [0,1] = soluble fraction of expressed
protein; 2337 after length<=400 filtering. Verified genuinely distinct from
L43's cached solubility dataset (441 overlapping sequences, but the two
labels are uncorrelated on that overlap, point-biserial r=0.048, p=0.32) —
same word "solubility," statistically orthogonal measurement.

Proxy: absolute charge average, `|(K+R)-(D+E)| / length`. Validated at
r=+0.305 (full set, n=2337) / +0.337 (held-out test, n=228) — one of the two
terms in Wilkinson & Harrison's (1991) published recombinant-solubility
discriminant, not a formula invented for this project. Confirmed NOT
hydrophobicity in disguise (r=-0.17 against GRAVY, L43's disqualified
proxy) and near-orthogonal to L51's signed net-charge proxy (r=-0.001) —
this asks "how far from neutral," not "which way."

## Steering results

| alpha | real mean | random mean | diff | significant | n | degenerate (real) |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 0.1 | 0.0324 | 0.0305 | +0.0018 | **yes** | 141 | 7/150 |
| 0.25 | 0.0350 | 0.0305 | +0.0039 | **yes** | 140 | 9/150 |
| 0.5 | 0.0426 | 0.0303 | +0.0125 | **yes** | 138 | 11/150 |
| 1.0 | 0.0767 | 0.0307 | +0.0414 | yes | 108 | 40/150 |
| 2.0 | 0.1011 | 0.0301 | +0.0911 | yes | 78 | 62/150 |
(baseline mean 0.0304, n=150, 7/150 degenerate)

Significant and monotonic across the entire safe range (+0.0018 -> +0.0039
-> +0.0125) — by criteria 1-2 alone, this looks identical in shape to
L54's clean PASS.

**Residue-exclusion robustness (criterion 3): FAILS.** Dominant substituted
residues at alpha=0.5 are E and L (E is literally one of the proxy's own
four terms — `|(K+R)-(D+E)|` — the same strictness level as L54's G-vs-A
check). Excluding both: effect collapses from +0.0125 to +0.0003, CI
[-0.0028, 0.0035] — crosses zero, not significant. Essentially all of the
apparent effect evaporates once its own defining residue is removed. This
is the same composition-collapse-artifact shape as L42 v1's poly-leucine
false positive and L51's alpha=1.0 spike, not a genuine broad steering
effect.

## Why: vector-geometry check against L55 (disorder)

Rather than leaving this as an unexplained artifact, rebuilt L54, L55, and
L57's SEED=0 steering vectors from scratch (`plm_steering/l58_vector_geometry_crosscheck.py`,
runnable, saves both the per-layer vectors and this table to
`plm_steering/l58_vector_geometry_out/`) and computed cosine similarity
between every pair, per-layer and on the full 33-layer concatenation:

| comparison | full-vector cosine | deep layers (30-32) |
|---|---|---|
| L57 (expression) vs. L54 (catalytic) | -0.127 | -0.26 to -0.38 (mildly opposed) |
| L57 (expression) vs. L55 (disorder) | **+0.376** | **+0.56 to +0.67** |
| L54 (catalytic) vs. L55 (disorder) | -0.315 | -0.51 to -0.70 (opposed) |

L57's direction is **not independent of L55's** — real, substantial overlap
concentrated in the deepest layers, and stronger than a first informal look
suggested. This makes biological sense: eSol's soluble-expression-yield
label and DisProt's intrinsic-disorder fraction are independently known to
be related in the literature (disordered regions commonly reduce
solubility/expression), so a shared component of direction is not a
coincidence. L55's disorder effect is directionally robust across 3 seeds
(`studies/L55_DISORDER_STEERING.md`) even though its own residue-exclusion
check is seed-sensitive (2 of 3 seeds pass); L57's result is best read as a
partial, noisier echo of that same real direction, filtered through a
proxy (charge-based) that happens to composition-collapse more easily than
TOP-IDP does.

## Verdict: AMBIGUOUS — real signal, not independent evidence of a 6th steerable property

| criterion | result |
|---|---|
| 1. beats random control, real CI | **PASS** |
| 2. dose-response | **PASS** |
| 3. residue-exclusion robust | **FAIL** — effect vanishes to ~0 excluding E, L |
| 4. proxy pre-validated | **PASS** (r=0.305-0.337) |
| 5. beats prior technique | N/A |
| 6. adequately powered | **PASS** (n=150) |

Not a clean KILL (there is a real, non-trivial vector-geometry relationship
to a confirmed-real effect elsewhere) and not a PASS (fails the artifact
check outright, unlike L55's partial 2/3 pass). The correct characterization
is: **this result is not independent evidence for expression yield as a
6th distinct steerable capability** — it is largely explained by disorder's
already-established effect leaking through a related, weaker, more
collapse-prone proxy.

## Methodological takeaway

Before writing off (or accepting) an AMBIGUOUS steering result as pure
noise or a standalone finding, checking its steering vector's cosine
similarity against every OTHER validated target's vector is a cheap,
informative diagnostic — it turned an unexplained borderline case into an
explained one here. Worth applying by default whenever running more than
one target property in the same batch.

## Cost

Single script run, `plm_steering/l57_run_repro.py`, 5 alphas x 2 directions
x 150 eval sequences, Apple Silicon MPS, ~5 minutes. The vector-geometry
cross-check (`plm_steering/l58_vector_geometry_crosscheck.py`, rebuilding
L54/L55/L57's steering vectors and computing pairwise cosine similarity)
cost one additional ~2-minute embedding pass, not a full steering sweep.
Raw scores/sequences saved to `plm_steering/l57_repro_out/results.json`;
the rebuilt vectors and cosine-similarity table saved to
`plm_steering/l58_vector_geometry_out/`.
